In this regard TinyRange should be thought of the same as any other programming environment (like Python, Node.js, Microsoft 365 with Macros, etc...).</p> <p>It does not install drivers or change system configuration or run background tasks so a system without a TinyRange instance running is equivalent to a system without TinyRange.</p> <p>Hardware accelerated virtualization does imply additional attack surface on the host kernel but both Windows (once installed) and MacOS grant access to unprivileged users and most Linux distributions configure this by default. The hardware acceleration simply allows regular processes to run code while capturing accesses to hardware devices. It does not grant access to hardware on its own.</p>"},{"location":"for-sysadmins/#how-do-tinyrange-virtual-machines-connect-to-the-internet","title":"How do TinyRange Virtual Machines connect to the internet?","text":"<p>TinyRange runs unprivileged so virtual machines are not directly connected to the host network.
